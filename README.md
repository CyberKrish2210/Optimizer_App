# Optimizer_App
It is an App made with Flet,pulp,knapsack .etc libraries for solving optimization problems with two variables.
Initially I wanted to make a mobile application for it but I was not able to convert it into an .apk or .ipa so it would be great if somebody would be able to contribute.
On the top left there is an Icon button which shows all the types of optimizaion questions it can solve and the expected format in which user is supposed to enter their questions.
I have created a PWA(Progressive Web APP) with this code with 000webhost .  visit https://optimizerky.000webhostapp.com/ for using the app . It would be a bit slow because i have used free web hosting platform.
